# Pittsburgh Users Update Summary

## What Was Accomplished

We successfully updated the CollegeStartupApp to have unique users for Pittsburgh schools, ensuring that each post has a unique poster (similar to how Boston is set up).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `users.json`
- Added **19 new unique users** for Pittsburgh-area universities
- **CMU**: 5 unique users (Marcus Johnson, Sarah Kim, Alex Chen, Emily Rodriguez, David Park)
- **Pitt**: 3 unique users (Jessica Wang, Michael Brown, Rachel Garcia)
- **Duquesne**: 3 unique users (Kevin Taylor, Lisa Wong, James Miller)
- **Additional universities**: 8 unique users for other Pittsburgh-area schools

### 2. Updated `UniStartupBoard.html`
- Modified the `getNUsersForUniversity` function to return unique users instead of repeating them
- Updated post generation logic to ensure each post gets a unique user
- Added safety checks to prevent posts from being created if there aren't enough users

## User Distribution

| University | Users | Posts | Status |
|------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Carnegie Mellon University | 5 | 5 | ✅ Complete |
| University of Pittsburgh | 3 | 3 | ✅ Complete |

**Total**: 19 unique Pittsburgh users for 19 posts

## Key Benefits

1. **Unique Posters**: Each post now has a unique poster, eliminating the previous issue of repeated users
2. **Realistic Representation**: Users have appropriate backgrounds matching their project areas
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more users if needed in the future
4. **Consistent**: Follows the same pattern as Boston and San Francisco areas

## User Profiles

Each new user has:
- Realistic first and last names
- Appropriate email addresses using university domains
- Relevant bios matching their project areas
- Unique profile pictures from Unsplash
- Proper graduation years (2025 or 2026)

## Technical Implementation

- Users are assigned unique IDs (26-44)
- Each user is properly geolocated with Pittsburgh coordinates
- Post generation logic now checks for sufficient users before creating posts
- No more user repetition in the `getNUsersForUniversity` function

The system now provides a much more realistic and engaging experience for users browsing Pittsburgh startup projects, with each project having its own unique creator profile.
